# Hotel Booking Website

This project is a simple hotel booking website built with HTML and CSS. The goal of the site is to showcase a clean, modern layout that works well on all screen sizes. It includes a navigation bar with a logo and links, a hero section with a large background image and centered text, a rooms section that displays different room options using CSS Grid, and a booking form styled with input fields and buttons. Flexbox and Grid are used to create responsive layouts, while media queries ensure the site adjusts smoothly for mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.

The website demonstrates the use of semantic HTML, custom styling, hover effects, and transitions to create a user-friendly experience. It is a front-end only project with no JavaScript added yet, but it could be extended in the future with form validation, accessibility improvements, or additional pages like About and Contact. This project serves as a practical example of applying HTML and CSS basics to design a simple, responsive hotel booking site.

## Future Improvements
- Add JavaScript for booking form validation and interactivity  
- Improve accessibility with ARIA labels and better focus states  
- Add more detailed room pages with pricing and availability  
- Create additional sections such as About, Contact, and Gallery  
- Optimize images and styles for faster loading speeds
